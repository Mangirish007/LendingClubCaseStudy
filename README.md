## General Information
- We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision i.e If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the  company and also If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
- The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
